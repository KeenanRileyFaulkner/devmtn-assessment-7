Insert is an O(n^2) algorithm because it must touch every element in the pre-existing array and 
shift it down a spot before it puts a new element at the beginning.
On the other hand, Append is a worst case O(n) algorithm 
(if the array exceeds space and must be transferred to different location), 
but average case of constant time.

Append scales much better in time performance. 
It's easy to tell based on the big O of the algorithms, and the collected data.

Note that this applies specifically to this instance (dealing with arrays). Unshift type operations may be 
used in other custom data structures with
vastly improved runtimes (such as linked lists or deques).
